	- Dixon, a big proponent of creating student accounts for children in order to siphon off public education money into private schools, told the audience that the way to deal with school shootings is to get rid of the Critical Race Theory “training” that has literally never been taught in any public school.
	- “Our schools have become so lax on allowing this, allowing parents to break the contract and then extend the rules or change the wording or allowing them to have a child that is in desperate need of help to go back into a classroom. And then tragedy happens. So, we need to see be seeing this ahead of time, and we need to have training. Instead of doing all this critical race training, how about we have training on spotting an emergency before it happens?”
