- ## Notes
	- Avoid Premature Error Messages
		- As a general rule of thumb, avoid displaying the error until the user has finished with the field and moved to the next field.
	- Reserve Error Styling for Errors Only
		- Summary:Â Premature error messages, aggressively styled fields, and unnecessarily disruptive system-status messages feel bad-mannered and increase cognitive load for users during otherwise simple tasks.
