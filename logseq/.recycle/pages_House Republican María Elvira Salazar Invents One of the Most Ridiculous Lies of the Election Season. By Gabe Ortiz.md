	- During an interview with the Fox News propaganda network this week, the Florida Republican and former reporter falsely claimed that she was “one of the founders of Spanish television, Univision and Telemundo.”
	- Univision was founded in September 1962, when Salazar was not quite 1 year old.
	- Telemundo, meanwhile, had already been around for several years before Salazar was born.
	- “On Jan. 11, while appearing as a guest on Ninoska Pérez’s daily show, Salazar amplified a false claim about the integrity of the vote in one of the election’s most closely contested states: Pennsylvania,” the Miami Herald reported in June 2021.
