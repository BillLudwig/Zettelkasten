- I registered to attend the JetBrains #Javascript Day #Conference on Nov. 2nd
- #Typescript [5.3 is in beta](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-3-beta/) so it's time to start getting ready for another migration. So far there aren't any breaking changes that should impact anything I work on.

- [Awesome VSCode](https://viatsko.github.io/awesome-vscode/) - Another one of those way too long lists of cool plugins for #VSCode. I kinda hate these but I'm saving it to share with the team on Monday. You know what they say, if you hate something share it with the people you work with.
- [lite youtube embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) - YouTube embed web component
- [aicolors.co](https://aicolors.co/) - #AI Tool for generating color schemes. Didn't work for me today but I'll try again in a few days and see if it's back. #[[Web Design]]
- [Onboard AI](https://www.getonboard.dev/) - Another #AI tool. This one can answer questions about public GitHub repositories.
- [CSS Text Portrait Builder](https://github.com/warengonzaga/css-text-portrait-builder) - Tool to create #CSS text portraits that are really damn good. I have no practical use for it but I will find one someday.
