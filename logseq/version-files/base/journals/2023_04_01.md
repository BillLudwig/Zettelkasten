- Getting burned out on [[WOW]] so I decided to give [[FFIV]] a try. Rolled a mage and melee character and it was pretty fun. The game feels too damn big and I don't understand anything but I had fun. Sadly after [[ESO]] I don't think I'll ever get into a game that isn't voice acted again. Reading is for nerds.
