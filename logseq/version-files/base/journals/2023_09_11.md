- Played a little [[Starfield]] this weekend. It's 100% a Bethesda game which means its quarky, the story is pretty shit, and I will invest 100's of hours into it.
- Project Gutenberg has an [Open Audiobook Collection](https://marhamilresearch4.blob.core.windows.net/gutenberg-public/Website/index.html) so when I finish the 30 or so books in my audible backlog and every podcast I'll still have stuff to listen to.
