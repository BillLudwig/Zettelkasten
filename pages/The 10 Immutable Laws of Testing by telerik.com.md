- ## Notes
	- 1. The bug count measures what annoys our users the most.
	- over 60% of users delete an app if
	    it freezes, crashes or displays an error message.
	- Bugs exist because we write them into our code: Complexity defeats good intentions.
	- Bugs (like tchotchkes) accumulate over time—every time we add or change functionality, to be precise.
	- Testing is the only tool we have faith in for finding bugs.
	- Anything you don’t test has at least one bug—probably more.
	- Testing is not a value-added task.
	- If “testing” means “reducing bugs,” then that puts testing into the “necessary work” category: stuff we have to do so that we can deliver value
	- What we are doing is managing risk
	- It’s easy to find bugs at the start; later, it gets harder.
	- You can’t start early enough.
	- Everyone involved in QA—users, analysts, testers, developers—is engaged in an eternal war against chaos.
