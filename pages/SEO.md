- ## Topical Authority
	- [Importance of Topical Authority: A Semantic SEO Case Study](https://www.oncrawl.com/technical-seo/importance-topical-authority-semantic-seo/)
		- Create topical map before starting publishing the first article
			- Crawl your competitors’ sitemaps to understand their topical maps.
			- Pull Google Trends related queries and related topics.
			- Collect data from autocomplete and search suggestions.
			- Notice how your competitors are connecting content hubs.
			- Use Google Knowledge Graph to pull relevant entities.
			- Use non-web resources to view the properties of entities and their hierarchies and connections.
		- Determine link count per page (< 15 links per page might be optimal)
			- Industry standards for internal link count to understand the minimum and maximum values.
			- Number of Named Entities in the content
			- The number of contexts for Named Entities
			- The “granularity” level of the content
			- A maximum of 1 link in each heading section
			- Linking entities belonging to the same type to their respective pages if they are in “list format”.
		- Determine the Anchor Texts in a Natural and Relevant Way in terms of Count, Words, and Position
			- I never use text in a page’s first paragraph as anchor text in links to that page.
			- I never use the first word of any paragraph on the page as anchor text to that page.
			- If
			   I link an article to another article from a different context or a 
			  side-topic, I always use one of the last heading’s paragraphs (Google 
			  calls this type of connection “Supplementary Content”.)
			- I always check competitor’s anchor texts for a specific article internally and externally.
			- I always try to use synonyms for a topic when creating anchor texts.
			- I
			   always check whether the “anchor text” exists in the targeted web 
			  page’s content and link source’s related heading text or not.
- ## Natural Language
	- Instead of using the same keyword over and over use natural synonyms and related phrases.
