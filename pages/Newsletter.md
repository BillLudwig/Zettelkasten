- ## Tips and Notes
	- Pick a niche you want to write about. Then go 2 niches deeper. [^1]
	- Leverage existing reputation and platforms. Build those first, or at the same time.
	- Pick a type of newsletter [^2]
		- Analyst
		- Curator
		- Expert
		- Reporter
		- Writer
	- Pick a name that is distinct and separate with it's own domain name (or tied to a blog that is it's own brand) [^1].
	- Choose a schedule that can be maintained, only increase when you are growing and monetizing successfully.
		- This is almost always every 1 or 2 weeks.
	- Use a repeatable content format that can be made into a simple template [^1]
- ## Growth by Newsletter Size
  collapsed:: true
	- 0 → 100: Friends, Family, Co-Workers
		- This creates accountability to keep writing. I recommend starting with a weekly newsletter you publish on the same day and time every week.
	- 100 → 5k: Publish on Twitter and LinkedIn Daily
		- Commit to 1 post a day and 1-2 threads a week for 3 months. Focus on posting consistently. Don’t worry about engagement (likes, comments, shares) at first.
		- Focus on converting views and followers to subscribers
		- At about 500 subscriptions swap recommendations with another small newsletter
	- 5k → 10k: Cross-Recommendations and Cross-Promos
		- Swap post-sign-up recommendations and feature each other’s newsletters in place of running ads. When doing cross promotions aim for click parity with your partners.
	- 10k → 100k: Paid Ads + All of The Above
		- Start testing Facebook (Meta) and Twitter ads with a small budget. You should be able to acquire subscribers for $1-$3.
