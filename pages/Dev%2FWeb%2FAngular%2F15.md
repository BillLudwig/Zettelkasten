	- [Advancements in the Angular Router](https://blog.angular.io/advancements-in-the-angular-router-5d69ec4c032) This was available in 14.2 but I'll probably look to implement with v15.
		- Better tree-shaking in the Router removing the old `HashLocationStrategy` and SSR code if not used
			- Saves about 11% of the router code size
		- No longer need to import RouterModule directly.
			- New: `providers: [provideRouter(appRoutes)]`
			- Old: `providers: [importProvidersFrom(RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes))]`
