- ## Notes
	- Inclusive Design Principles [^2]
		- Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases. We seek out exclusions, and use them as opportunities to create new and better experiences.
		- Recognize Exclusion: We acknowledge bias and recognize exclusions that happen because of mismatches between people and experience.
		- Learn from diversity: Inclusive Design puts people in the center throughout the process. Their fresh, diverse perspectives are the key to true insight.
		- Solve for one, extend to many: Everyone has abilities and limits. Creating products for people with permanent disabilities creates results that benefit everyone.
