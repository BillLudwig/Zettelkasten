		- Education: Provide educational content
			- Original studies — research efforts that result in new information
			- Data analysis — analysis of public or proprietary data that yields new insights
			- “Definitive” guides — coverage of important topics in a systematic way
			- Statistics pages — a curation of up-to-date statistics that saves research time
			- Listicles — a content structure that simplifies a huge number of details and examples
			- Infographics — helpful visuals of specific concepts, figures, or processes
		- Validation: Feel Supported or Challenged
			- Thought leadership — earned secrets, counter-narrative opinions, and personal narrative content can inspire others and invite them to share their perspective while referencing or rebuking yours
			- Awards and rankings — giving awards to people or including them in “best of” rankings validates their work, making it more likely they’ll link to such an award
		- Empowerment:
			- Tools: generators, graders, analyzers, and other web tools that simplify and speed up processes, such as: - Shopify’s [business name generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator), Squarespace’s [free logo maker](https://www.squarespace.com/logo), Ookla’s [web speed tester](https://www.speedtest.net/), Animalz’ Revive [content decay analyzer](https://revive.animalz.co/)
			- Quizzes & surveys: a list of questions that help readers learn about themselves or about their employees, customers, or other audiences, such as: Madison Reed’s [hair color quiz](https://www.madison-reed.com/color-advisor), Consalia’s [mindset survey](https://www.consalia.com/mindset-survey/)
