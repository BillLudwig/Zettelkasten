		- Education: Provide educational content
			- Original studies — research efforts that result in new information
			- Data analysis — analysis of public or proprietary data that yields new insights
			- “Definitive” guides — coverage of important topics in a systematic way

			- Listicles — a content structure that simplifies a huge number of details and examples
			- Infographics — helpful visuals of specific concepts, figures, or processes
		- Validation: Feel Supported or Challenged
			- Thought leadership — earned secrets, counter-narrative opinions, and personal narrative content can inspire others and invite them to share their perspective while referencing or rebuking yours
