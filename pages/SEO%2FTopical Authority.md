- ## [Importance of Topical Authority: A Semantic SEO Case Study](https://www.oncrawl.com/technical-seo/importance-topical-authority-semantic-seo/)
	- ### Create topical map before starting publishing the first article
		- Crawl your competitors’ sitemaps to understand their topical maps.
		- Pull Google Trends related queries and related topics.
		- Collect data from autocomplete and search suggestions.
		- Notice how your competitors are connecting content hubs.
		- Use Google Knowledge Graph to pull relevant entities.
		- Use non-web resources to view the properties of entities and their hierarchies and connections.
	- ### Determine link count per page (< 15 links per page might be optimal)
		- Industry standards for internal link count to understand the minimum and maximum values.
		- Number of Named Entities in the content
		- The number of contexts for Named Entities
		- The “granularity” level of the content
		- A maximum of 1 link in each heading section
		- Linking entities belonging to the same type to their respective pages if they are in “list format”.
	- ### Determine the Anchor Texts in a Natural and Relevant Way in terms of Count, Words, and Position
		- I never use text in a page’s first paragraph as anchor text in links to that page.
		- I never use the first word of any paragraph on the page as anchor text to that page.
		- If
		   I link an article to another article from a different context or a 
		  side-topic, I always use one of the last heading’s paragraphs (Google 
		  calls this type of connection “Supplementary Content”.)
		- I always check competitor’s anchor texts for a specific article internally and externally.
		- I always try to use synonyms for a topic when creating anchor texts.
		- I always check whether the “anchor text” exists in the targeted web 
		  page’s content and link source’s related heading text or not.
	- ### Determine the Contextual Vectors
		- > contextual vectors are the signals to determine a content’s angle. A topic can be “earthquake” and a context can be “comparing earthquakes”, “guessing earthquakes”, or “chronology of earthquake”.
	- ### Determine the Content Count be Written and Published
		- > Content count is not a ranking factor. Actually, telling more things with less content with more comprehensive and authoritative articles is better for many aspects such as crawl budget, PageRank distribution, backlink dilution, or cannibalization problems.
