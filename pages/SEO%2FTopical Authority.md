- ## [Importance of Topical Authority: A Semantic SEO Case Study](https://www.oncrawl.com/technical-seo/importance-topical-authority-semantic-seo/)
	- ### Create topical map before starting publishing the first article
	  collapsed:: true
		- Crawl your competitors’ sitemaps to understand their topical maps.
		- Pull Google Trends related queries and related topics.
		- Collect data from autocomplete and search suggestions.
		- Notice how your competitors are connecting content hubs.
		- Use Google Knowledge Graph to pull relevant entities.
		- Use non-web resources to view the properties of entities and their hierarchies and connections.
	- ### Determine link count per page (< 15 links per page might be optimal)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Industry standards for internal link count to understand the minimum and maximum values.
		- Number of Named Entities in the content
		- The number of contexts for Named Entities
		- The “granularity” level of the content
		- A maximum of 1 link in each heading section
		- Linking entities belonging to the same type to their respective pages if they are in “list format”.
	- ### Determine the Anchor Texts in a Natural and Relevant Way in terms of Count, Words, and Position
	  collapsed:: true
		- I never use text in a page’s first paragraph as anchor text in links to that page.
		- I never use the first word of any paragraph on the page as anchor text to that page.
		- If
		   I link an article to another article from a different context or a 
		  side-topic, I always use one of the last heading’s paragraphs (Google 
		  calls this type of connection “Supplementary Content”.)
		- I always check competitor’s anchor texts for a specific article internally and externally.
		- I always try to use synonyms for a topic when creating anchor texts.
		- I always check whether the “anchor text” exists in the targeted web 
		  page’s content and link source’s related heading text or not.
	- ### Determine the Contextual Vectors
	  collapsed:: true
		- > contextual vectors are the signals to determine a content’s angle. A topic can be “earthquake” and a context can be “comparing earthquakes”, “guessing earthquakes”, or “chronology of earthquake”.
	- ### Determine the Content Count be Written and Published
	  collapsed:: true
		- > Content count is not a ranking factor. Actually, telling more things with less content with more comprehensive and authoritative articles is better for many aspects such as crawl budget, PageRank distribution, backlink dilution, or cannibalization problems.
	- ### Determine the URL Categories and Hierarchy
	- ### Create a Topical Hierarchy with Contextual Vectors by Adjusting it with URL Hierarchy
	  collapsed:: true
		- >Sub-topics have been confirmed to be used by Google during January 2020 but actually, Google has mentioned them as “Neural Nets” or “Neural Networks” before. In the Google Developers’ YouTube channel, they also showed a nice summary about how topics are connected to each other within a hierarchy and logic. That’s why again, taxonomy and ontology are key for semantic SEO.
		-
	- ### Adjust Heading Vectors
		- > Heading vectors are actually the order of the headings as a signal for determining the main angle and topic of the content. According to the Google Quality Rater Guidelines, content is viewed as having three different sections: “Main Content”, “Ads”, and “Supplementary Content”.
		- Whatever the search engine says, use [semantic HTML tags](https://www.oncrawl.com/technical-seo/page-content-html5-tags/), including heading tags.
		- Heading vectors start from the title tag, thus the headings and the title tag should comply with each other.
		- Every
		   heading should focus on different information and any paragraph after 
		  those headings shouldn’t repeat the information that was provided 
		  before.
		- Headings that focus on similar ideas should be grouped together.
		- Any heading that should include another entity should also be linked to it.
		- Every heading’s content should have the right format with lists, tables, descriptive definitions…
