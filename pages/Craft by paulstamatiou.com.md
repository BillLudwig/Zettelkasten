- ## Notes
	- As a designer I'm motivated not only by identifying and successfully solving problems for people through software, but also by the care, attention to detail and craft I'm able to put into it along with the team.
	- Quality is all-encompassing.
	    
	        It’s accessibility so that everyone can use it.
	        It’s performance and ease of use so it respects the user’s time and helps them accomplish their tasks when they need.
	        It’s reliability so they can feel good about having this tool in their pocket for when they need it.
	        It's durability with designs and components that can scale to withstand future needs and uses.
	        It’s well-considered.
	        It’s the feeling that a lot of time and care went into creating the product: that someone has already thought of you.
	        Of course, it can also be a bit extra and bring delight in unexpected places and important moments.
	- Quality happens throughout the entire project whether you're cognizant of it or not. It happens when identifying the customer problem to solve, designing a solution, validating it, building it,  maintaining it, and even when you sunset the product.
	- Lots of things can affect the quality of your product, especially on large teams, including culture, incentives, skills and tools.
	- Leadership, organizational support and incentives. Does the organization care about quality? What does quality mean to them? How does it tie into the career ladder, promotions and prioritization frameworks? Do they focus more on execution speed over quality?
	- Culture around quality. To maintain a shared, company-wide understanding of the company's specific stance is on quality, how does quality get rewarded, celebrated and prioritized? Is there a process in place for delaying a release and having a retro when the quality bar slips? Who decides when quality has slipped? Who's accountable for addressing it?
	- Trouble identifying issues. Do you have the right people with the right skills and motivations to flag quality-related issues? Do they have the right tools?
	- Poor ticket/engineer fit. The onus is not just on designers to help identify and document issues to be addressed. What happens when a particular engineer picks up the next ticket and it involves a specific set of knowledge they may not have, for example like knowing about the nuances of animating collection views on iOS.
	- Inadequate tooling for effective design/engineer pairing.
	- Liberal use of "MVP" or "it's just an experiment". Does the team use those terms to skirt around typical quality standards and ship something subpar?
	- Quality is the way you work. Focusing on quality doesn't have to mean that suddenly your project scope has become bloated with a slew of tasks that will take 25% longer to complete. It can be prioritizing more complete, well-considered chunks of functionality
	- SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete).
	- Build a working style that always pairs thinking about the long-term design direction of your surface area along with the short-term.
	- Bring design and engineering closer. There’s still a ton of onus on the designer to help illustrate and share their vision with their team.
	- A shared understanding of what types of work meets and what type of work doesn't meet your quality bar, along with executive support, can help with prioritization. Doing so can help realize the compounding effects of smaller quality and design tickets.
	- Incentivize and commit to sunsetting features that are no longer your core focus, have low usage, or are otherwise detrimental to your product.
