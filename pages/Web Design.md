		- Use space to group related elements
			- Place related elements in the same container
			- Space related elements close together
			- Make related elements look similar
			- Align related elements in a continuous line
		- Be consistent - similar elements look and work in a similar way
		- Ensure similar looking elements function similarly
		- Create a clear visual hierarchy (Squint Test)
		- Remove unnecessary styles (that add visual complexity but don't convey information or group elements)
		- Use colour purposefully - sparingly and with purpose
		- Ensure interface elements have a 3:1 contrast ratio
		- Ensure text has a 4.5:1 contrast ratio
