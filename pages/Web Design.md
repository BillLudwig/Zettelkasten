	- [16 little UI design rules that make a big impact](https://www.adhamdannaway.com/blog/ui-design/16-ui-design-rules)
		- Use space to group related elements
			- Place related elements in the same container
			- Space related elements close together
			- Make related elements look similar
			- Align related elements in a continuous line
		- Be consistent - similar elements look and work in a similar way
		- Ensure similar looking elements function similarly
		- Create a clear visual hierarchy (Squint Test)
		- Remove unnecessary styles (that add visual complexity but don't convey information or group elements)
		- Use colour purposefully - sparingly and with purpose
		- Ensure interface elements have a 3:1 contrast ratio
		- Ensure text has a 4.5:1 contrast ratio
			- Small text (18px and under) needs a minimum contrast of 4.5:1.
			- Large text (above 18px with bold weight or above 24px with regular weight) needs a minimum contrast of 3:1.
		- Donâ€™t rely on colour alone as an indicator
		- Use a single sans serif typeface
		- Use a typeface with taller lower case letters
		- Limit the use of uppercase (IT'S LOUD AND DIFFICULT TO READ)
		- Use regular and bold font weights only
		- Avoid pure black text (high contrast against white, causes eye strain and fatigue)
		- Left align text
		- Use at least 1.5 line height for body text
