	- Your phone number is often the gateway to stealing access to your money and your identity. After the hacker takes your phone number, they can log into your email account without using your password.
	- The “Forgot My Password” option on the rest of your accounts (think of your credit cards, social media, bank, etc.) is usually set by default to send a link or code to your email or phone.
	- Hackers SIM-swap people by calling their phone service providers (also known as carriers), impersonating their victims, and claiming that their phone was lost or stolen. If your phone is lost or stolen, service providers can transfer your phone number to a new phone, and SIM, of your choice.
	- To start with, the hacker needs to know which service provider to call. They can use websites like Free Carrier Lookup, that will identify any phone number’s service provider for free.
	- January 2020 study from Princeton University investigated the default security screening for five major carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, Tracfone, and U.S. Mobile)
	- The study’s results showed that there were certain kinds of information that covered one or more of all five major carriers’ security questions. This included personal information and usage details such as the account owner’s current or former addresses, age / year of birth, email address, and/or phone numbers that the phone might have recently called. This information is available online for any phone number.
	- you can search any phone number and find the names and addresses associated with it.
	- Finally, the site identifies “possible relatives” and “possible associates”. The “possible relatives” are identified be based on whether these people were registered to the same phone or address during the user’s childhood years (ages 1 through 18). The “possible associates” are often former neighbors or roommates.
	- if one name is approximately 20 or more years older than the owner, has the same last name, and lived at the same address during the owner’s childhood years, you can conclude that is a parent. Likewise you can identify probable siblings that were children at the same address with the same last name. You can use the same process to figure out who are the owner’s children.
	- WAtools.io can look up if a phone number uses WhatsApp and download the owner’s profile photo. Truecaller.com can find out how people identify you in their contact books, like “John the IT guy”. There is also a Python script named Ignorant.py that can look up if a phone number uses Instagram, Snapchat, or Amazon. Data breach websites like HaveIBeenPwned.com will look up if any given phone number has been included in the data stolen by hackers and posted on the dark web. Data breach sites can identify personal information about the owner such as where they shop, play video games, or even what kind of car they own.
	- many articles have been written and experts have weighed in on whether eSIMs will make our phones more or less safe. The consensus among experts is that eSIMs are not expected to have a major impact on the threat of SIM-swapping.
	- Most phone service providers will let you set up a password to use in case your phone is lost or stolen.
	- Start using an authenticator as your two factor authentication instead of text messages.
	- Sign up for a free account on a data breach website like HaveIBeenPwned.com that will notify you as soon as your phone number or other information appears in a data breach so that you know to change your password.
	- Put a freeze on your credit score with the three main credit bureaus Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
	- Remove your data from People-Search and Data Breach Websites.
