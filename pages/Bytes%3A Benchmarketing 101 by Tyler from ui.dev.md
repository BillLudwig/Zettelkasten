	  When the hot new OSS tool is not quite as blazing as it claimed 
	  
	  Benchmarketing 101
	  FOMO is a hell of a drug. That’s why, no matter how rational we *think* we are, our lizard brains simply can’t resist a “10x lightning fast” benchmark for a new OSS tool.
	  OSS creators know this, which is why some of them spend a lot of time crafting benchmarks that always show their tool as being #1 Most Blazingest. And while it’s natural to want to highlight the strengths of your own project, sometimes this benchmarketing (🥁) can cause some real confusion.
	  Vercel recently came under fire for their Turbopack-vs-Vite benchmarks, Bun was questioned (but then mostly defended for their SSR benchmarks, and the list goes on. So, as concerned citizens of JavaScript-land, we wanted to share a few benchmarking practices to look out for when evaluating various OSS claims.
	  Let’s start with a few red flags 🚩:
	  
	  
	  Not public: If you can’t run a benchmark yourself, you should probably be skeptical.
	  
	  
	  Lacks context: Does the benchmark include context about what their assumptions are? Measuring performance on “hello world” can be wildly different than a huge application.
	  
	  
	  Unclear methodology: Things like what machine the benchmarks are run on, how many times they ran, and what use cases are covered, all matter. If those things are unclear, your spidey senses should be going off.
	  
	  
	  Here are a few best practices we love to see 🤩:
	  
	  
	  Everyone agrees on what to measure: Standardized benchmarks ftw. Codefied standards are more common for larger and more established projects like browsers — but the more we can all agree on, the better.
	  
	  
	  You benchmark against yourself: This is the best way to give comparisons that are truly 🍎’s to 🍎’s, and there’s a lot to be said for transparently running your own race.
	  
	  
	  Bottom Line: In a perfect world, we’d have some sort of third-party benchmark for benchmarking the quality of every benchmark. But since that job sounds like actual hell, we’ll probably just have to keep trying to decipher the data ourselves — and celebrate the times when great benchmarking helps us all win.
