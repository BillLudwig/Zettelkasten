- ## By Newsletter Size
	- 0 → 100: Friends, Family, Co-Workers
		- This creates accountability to keep writing. I recommend starting with a weekly newsletter you publish on the same day and time every week. [^1]
	- 100 → 5k: Publish on Twitter and LinkedIn Daily
		- Commit to 1 post a day and 1-2 threads a week for 3 months. Focus on posting consistently. Don’t worry about engagement (likes, comments, shares) at first. [^1]
		- Focus on converting views and followers to subscribers [^1]
		- At about 500 subscriptions swap recommendations with another small newsletter [^1]
	- 5k → 10k: Cross-Recommendations and Cross-Promos
		- Swap post-sign-up recommendations and feature each other’s newsletters in place of running ads. When doing cross promotions aim for click parity with your partners. [^1]
	- 10k → 100k: Paid Ads + All of The Above
		- Start testing Facebook (Meta) and Twitter ads with a small budget. You should be able to acquire subscribers for $1-$3. [^1]
