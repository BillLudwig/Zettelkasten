- People run on scripts
- Nonverbal 2/3 of meaning of communication
- 4 laws of behavior
	- Everyone is suffering and insecure
	- Everyone is wearing a mask (persona/projection)
	- Everyone pretends not to wear a mask
	- Everyone is a product of childhood suffering and reward
- Most people will try to persuade the mask, instead of the person behind it.
- 4 ways to see people
	- People are broken - get angry and try to 'fix' the problem and level the playing field (get even)
	- People are different - still get angry but don't feel need to 'fix' the problem and even the playing field
	- People are facts - don't get angry/judge because see other people as unchangeable.
	- People are reasons - see reason (or make one up) behind behavior (childhood suffering and reward)
- The brain is the star of the show, not the person.
- Our ancestors passed down a whole lot of stuff. All of it was meant to keep us alive, but some of it no longer serves us.
- 3 filters of influence:

	- Focus

	- Tribe
	- Emotion
