## #Journal
	- Attempting to publish on GitHub pages, probably broke something important though.
		- It seems to work. Auto-deployments are set up and work with the built-in Logseq sync. Just waiting on [[DNS]] to see if I set up DNS correctly. If I did https://billludwig.me will be live!
		- It all works pretty much as expected. Thanks to https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish
	- Cleaned up a lot of junk pages and navigation. I'm sure there is much more to do.
